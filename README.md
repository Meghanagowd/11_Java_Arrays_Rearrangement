# Day 11 – Arrays: Rearrangement & Two-Pointer Logic

Today I solved two array rearrangement problems from GeeksforGeeks.

## Problems Solved

1. Move All Zeroes to End  
2. Move All Negative Elements to End  

## Concepts Practiced

- Two-pointer technique
- In-place array modification
- Maintaining relative order of elements
- Linear traversal (O(n) time complexity)
- Array partitioning logic

## Key Learning

Improved control over array rearrangement problems and strengthened
understanding of partition-style logic.

Reinforced single-pass traversal and efficient space usage.
